# AGB-CPU-03
This is a reverse engineered board by me, Natalie the Nerd.
I made this to learn and fix some super corroded boards I have.

23.10.2023 UPDATE: 
- I added a kicad file for the outline of the GBA board only. Feel free to use this as the base of any of your projects for e.g. a Raspberry Pi, ESP32 etc.
- added gerbers

### Shout out to:

- the original repair manual for the AGB which helped me confirm my first ever reverse engineered schematic
- HDR for his HQ board scans which I used to help draw up the kicad footprints
